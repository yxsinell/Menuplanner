# Lozano's Food - Weekly Menu Planner

This project is a simple web application created with the support of artificial intelligence (AI) using prompt engineering, showcasing my ability to integrate advanced technology into solution development. While AI was instrumental in the development, the focus of this project is to apply and demonstrate my skills as a QA tester in a professional setting.

## üéØ Project Objective
The main goal is to use advanced QA tools and techniques to ensure the quality and functionality of the *Menu Planner* in a web environment, applying modern testing methodologies and agile development principles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Applied Methodologies and Techniques
- **AI and Prompt Engineering**: Development of the base code by optimizing the use of artificial intelligence for efficient solution generation.
- **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** and **ATD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development)**: Application of these methodologies to ensure tests are aligned with user requirements and expectations.
- **Agile Scrum**: Working under this methodology to iteratively improve the product, prioritizing collaboration and effective communication in a simulated agile development environment.
- **Manual and Regression Testing**: Designing and executing manual test cases focused on identifying bugs and validating functionalities throughout the development cycle.
- **Error Detection and Reporting**: Using tools like **AssertThat** to generate detailed test reports, identifying and documenting bugs for rapid resolution.

## üìà Learning Outcomes
- Effective management of testing in complex environments, applying a collaborative approach to ensure product quality and functionality.
- Development and improvement of skills in scenario-based and regression testing, validating changes without compromising system integrity.
- Optimization of AI usage in software development, applying prompt engineering to create and adjust functionalities rapidly.
